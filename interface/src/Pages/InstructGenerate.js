            <p className="text-2xl mb-2">In this HIT you will be shown three objects in a Practice round, followed by one more object in a Test round. 
            You will be asked to come up with ways of utilizing common everyday objects outside of their intended use. </p>

            <p className="text-2xl mb-2">The goal is to come up with creative ideas, which are ideas that strike people as clever, unusual, interesting, uncommon, humorous, innovative, or different. 
            Your ideas don't have to be practical or realistic; they can be silly or strange, even, so long as they are CREATIVE uses rather than ordinary uses. You can type in as many ideas as you can, but creative quality is more important than quantity. 
            It's better to have a few really good ideas than a lot of uncreative ones. You have 60 seconds to respond to each object.</p>

            <p className="text-2xl mb-8">In the Practice round, to spark your imagination, youâ€™ll see ideas generated by AI (i.e., ChatGPT). This will be shown on the right side of the screen.</p>
