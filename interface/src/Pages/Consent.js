                <p className="text-main mb-2">Researchers at the <strong>University of Toronto</strong> are studying how peopleâ€™s usage of <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> impacts their creative thinking abilities. Nowadays, people are often offloading tedious cognitive tasks to various AI tools to boost productivity and save time. Our project investigates the implications this has on human creativity.</p>
                <p className="text-main mb-2">You are invited to participate in this study if you are at least <strong>18 years of age</strong>. As a participant, you will be asked to come up with alternative methods of utilizing common household items besides their intended use. You will also be asked to provide some demographic information and general thoughts on this survey. By taking part, you will help us better understand how we can guide responsible AI development and usage.</p>
                <p className="text-main mb-2">There are no potential risks or preparatory requirements for completing the study. We will have mechanisms in place to ensure that information collected during the study will be kept separate from identification, and not disclosed to anyone besides those named below. <strong>No personally identifiable information will be collected.</strong></p>
                <p className="text-main mb-2">We expect the survey to take around <strong>10 minutes</strong> to complete. If you are a <em>Prolific worker</em>, you will receive the monetary amount detailed on Prolific as compensation for your time. If you were recruited offline, you will be entered into a draw for <strong>5 USD Amazon gift cards</strong>. Odds are detailed in the advertisement post, but you can expect a winning probability of at least 30%.</p>
                <p className="text-main mb-2">As the results of this evaluation will be of interest to a wide number of communities, we are asking your permission to include your data in any reports that we publish, in a <u>de-identified, aggregated format</u>.
