    "Bottle": 
    `
    Substitute: What if the bottle was made of a different material? For instance, a bottle made of cork could be a biodegradable storage solution for camping trips.   
  
    Combine: Could you combine a bottle with something else to create a new product? For example, a bottle with a built-in light could serve as a portable lantern for outdoor use.  
    
    Adapt: How could you adapt a bottle for another purpose? A large bottle could be cut and modified to serve as a bird feeder.  
    
    Modify: What if you changed the shape or color of the bottle? A bottle with a unique, artistic shape could be used as a decorative vase.  
    
    Put to another use: Have you thought about using a bottle for something completely different? Bottles could be filled with colored sand or small pebbles and used as door stoppers.  
    
    Eliminate: What if you removed a part of the bottle? For instance, removing the bottom of a glass bottle could turn it into a stylish lampshade.  
    
    Reverse: Could you use a bottle in a completely opposite way? Instead of filling it, use it to create a vacuum for science experiments.  

    `,
    "Ball": 
    `
    Substitute: What if we replace the material of the ball with something else? For example, a ball made of rubber bands could become an elastic toy or a stress reliever.  
   
    Combine: What could we create if we combine the ball with something else? For instance, integrating a light source inside could make it a unique, playful lamp.  
    
    Adapt: How can we modify the ball for another purpose? What if it's inspired by something else? A ball could be hollowed out and lined with soft fabric to create a small pet bed.  
    
    Modify: Consider altering the shape, size, color, or any other attribute of the ball to create new uses. A flattened ball could function as a frisbee, or a large, inflated ball could become an exercise tool.  
    
    Put to another use: Think about completely different uses for the ball. It could be used as a decorative element in a child's room or even as a makeshift pillow during a camping trip.  
    
    Eliminate: What if parts of the ball were removed? A ball with sections removed could act as a unique frame for a spherical sculpture or a plant holder.  
    
    Reverse: What would happen if we reversed the ball's purpose? Instead of being thrown, maybe it catches or stores things - like a container or a bowl.
    `,
    "Fork": 
    `
    Substitute: Think about replacing the prongs of the fork with different materials. What if they were made of rubber? It could become a safe toy for a young child or a stress relief tool for adults.  
    
    Combine: Imagine combining a fork with other objects. For example, could a fork and a comb be combined? It might create a unique hair styling tool.  
    
    Adapt: Consider how a fork could be adapted to serve another purpose. If you change the scale of it, a large fork could be an interesting garden decoration or, with longer prongs, it could be used as a rake.  
    
    Modify: Altering the shape or color of a fork could lead to new uses. If it was flattened and made from a stronger material, it could serve as a mini crowbar.   
    
    Put to another use: Brainstorm completely different uses for the fork. What about using it as a makeshift easel for small paintings or photos? Or bending it into a hook for hanging jewelry?  
    
    Eliminate: Consider what might happen if parts of the fork were removed. If you took away some of the prongs, could it serve as a letter opener or a tool for scoring patterns into clay or dough?  
    
    Reverse: Think about what would happen if you reversed the fork's purpose. Instead of using it to put food into your mouth, could it be used to prepare food, like mashing avocados for guacamole?
    `,
    "Lightbulb": 
    `
    Substitute: Imagine if we replace the filament in the lightbulb with a small plant to create a mini terrarium.   
    
    Combine: Could we pair the lightbulb with a string of other lightbulbs to create a decorative garland for parties?  
    
    Adapt: What if we take inspiration from a hot air balloon and use the heat of the bulb to lift a miniature basket?  
    
    Modify: What about changing the color of the bulb to create a mood light for different occasions, or altering the size to create a giant lightbulb lamp?  
    
    Put to another use: A lightbulb could be used as a small vase for tiny flowers, or as a container for spices.  
    
    Eliminate: If we remove the internal parts of the bulb, we're left with a glass enclosure. We could fill it with sand and small shells to create a beach-themed ornament.  
    
    Reverse: What if we used the lightbulb not as a source of light, but as a container for darkness - a novelty 'dark bulb' for people who love the night?  
    `,
    "Toothbrush": 
    `
    Substitute: What if we replaced the bristles of a toothbrush with a different material? For example, if we used rubber instead of nylon, it could double as a massager for tired fingers or even a pencil eraser.  
   
    Combine: What if we combined a toothbrush with a small digital clock? It could be a timer to ensure you brush your teeth for the recommended two minutes.   
    
    Adapt: Can the toothbrush be inspired by something else? For instance, inspired by a paintbrush, it could be used to create delicate art or even touch up areas when painting a room.  
    
    Modify: If we alter the size of a toothbrush, making it much smaller, it could be used to clean hard-to-reach areas in appliances or tiny crevices in a car's dashboard.  
    
    Put to another use: A toothbrush could be used to clean the keys on a keyboard or the crevices in jewelry. Moreover, it could also serve as a tool for grooming pets or even as a makeshift bookmark.  
    
    Eliminate: If we remove the handle of a toothbrush, the bristled end could be used as a cleaning tool for nails or as a texturizing tool in pottery.  
    
    Reverse: Instead of using the toothbrush to clean, what if it's used to apply substances? The toothbrush could be used to apply hair dye for a streaked effect, or to spread glue evenly on a surface for crafting.   
    `,
    "Backpack": 
    `
    Substitute: What if we replace the fabric of the backpack with a waterproof or fireproof material? This could turn it into a safe and portable storage for important documents or gadgets when going on adventures.  
   
    Combine: Can we combine the backpack with a foldable chair? This would allow it to serve as a portable seat when you're out hiking or waiting in long queues.  
    
    Adapt: What if we adapt the backpack to include solar panels? It could then serve as a portable charger for your electronic devices.  
    
    Modify: How about altering the backpack to include a built-in cooler section? This would make it ideal for picnics or outdoor events as it can keep food and drinks cool.  
    
    Put to another use: Consider using the backpack as a pet carrier for small pets. With the right modifications, it could be a comfortable and convenient way to bring your pet along on outings.  
    
    Eliminate: What if we remove the traditional storage section of the backpack, leaving only the straps and back panel? This could serve as a lightweight harness or support for carrying larger items.  
    
    Reverse: How about reversing the purpose of the backpack? Instead of using it to carry items, it could be turned into a portable, mini cupboard or storage unit when hung up, perfect for camping trips or dorm rooms.
